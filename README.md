# DEHOGT
This package implements a generalized linear model (GLM) approach for identifying DE genes. It allows for different distributions of read count data (quasi-Poisson or negative binomial) and also incorporates treatment information, normalization factors, and thresholds for significance and log2 fold change in its analysis.
